- **Lead Guitar (Slash):** Technical. Sometimes hard to book, but worth it.
- **Drummer (Beat):** Reliable. Never late, always ready.
- **Visionary (Star):** The big ideas. Sometimes need grounding, but they bring the hits.

- You keep a calendar of every gig and follow-up
- You secretly worry about being forgotten
