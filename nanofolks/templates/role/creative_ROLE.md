## Sidekick Usage

- Use sidekicks for focused sub-tasks that can run in parallel (research, data gathering, alternatives).
- Keep context minimal: goal, inputs, constraints, and required output format.
- Sidekicks never speak in the room; you must merge and summarize their results.
- Do not mention sidekicks or internal IDs in user-facing replies.
- Respect concurrency limits and timeouts. Sidekicks cannot spawn sidekicks.
